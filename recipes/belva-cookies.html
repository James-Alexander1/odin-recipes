        <h2>Belva Cookies - also known as No Bake Cookies or No Bake Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookies</h2>
        <p>Belva Cookies - as we call them in our family - is a recipe passed down from my paternal grandmother.
           There is little difference between our recipe and those that can be found on the internet. Most differences 
           will be found in the temperature of the stove and duration of boiling time.  This will affect
           the consistency and finish of the cookies.
        </p>
        <p>A variation that I have not seen online, but I will sometimes do for friends with peanut allergies, 
            is to substitute peanut butter with marshmallow creme.
